I'm going to install the suite into a virtual machine while i migrate my windows sigmon VM to a dedicated linux machine ... haven't been gaming much.

Ok, so first thing is install a few linux servers and utilities:

# apt-get install libpcap-dev iw  wireless-tools mongodb ntpdate python-bson ptpython

Additionally, these are useful, some required:

apt-get macchanger screen htop discus wget gcc cpp g++ make 

Then, python modules, from the requirements file, which is in the etc/ directory:

# pip install $(cat requirements.txt)

After this, you must move "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/dist-packages/manuf.py" to "/usr/lib/python2.7" and also edit manuf.py (line xxx)
on that directory AND also edit sigmon.py (line 1554) to point to /data/sigmon/etc/manuf. I'll try and fix that, but manuf is broken right now.

So pretty much set, now we should be able to do:

# bin/cmd.sh first_setup

then, just do a ./run and open a web browser to localhost:443 and enjoy :)

(I think. I have to upgrade to debian unstable to get the correct mongodb...)

Yea, thats it, and then you've gotta change a ton of hard coded URL's.....


-- NOTE - THIS IS SUPER ALPHA SOFTWARE -- RUN IT AT YOUR OWN RISK -- YOU will NOTICE SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT YOUR CAT AFTER INSTALLING
